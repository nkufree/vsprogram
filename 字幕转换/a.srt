2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,440
I can't believe this is my job right now

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,599
I'm barrel and for this episode of

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,759
around the world I'm trying something a

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,500
little different

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,539
a few weeks ago I made this story about

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,340
noodles

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,279
and in it I said I'm not doing instant

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,079
noodles that is a whole other episode

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,720
and if you want that one let me know

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,460
turns out you wanted that episode

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,980
so I had to think I couldn't film in a

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,320
Noodle Factory and it also didn't seem

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,000
that interesting to film in a Noodle

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,079
Factory

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,160
but

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,620
I had a kind of fun idea

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,620
I asked on YouTube how you guys liked to

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,660
prepare instant noodles where you lived

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,399
and the response was crazy

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,800
totally crazy

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,140
so I went through the responses and I

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,180
picked out eight that I wanted to try

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,140
myself

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,699
I went shopping

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,339
and I'm going to prepare eight of your

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,280
recipes from eight countries to see the

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,079
different ways that people prepare

29
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,479
instant noodles around the world

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,620
so this is the instant noodle episode

31
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:22,920
[Music]

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,019
the first noodle dish we're trying is

33
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,459
from Brazil

34
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,140
it's a simple recipe two ingredients

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,959
instant noodles and soft cheese so I'm

36
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,720
going to boil the noodles

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:37,180
once they're ready drain most of the

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,078
water add the seasoning packet add some

39
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,400
of the soft cheese stir stir stir

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,340
and then

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,759
[Music]

42
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,860
okay so this is kind of like a tomatoey

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,319
cheesy

44
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,759
hmm

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,500
it's really good

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,000
the noodles are really good they kind of

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,060
remind me of Top Ramen noodles

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,500
the Tomato flavor is really interesting

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,540
I've never had that one before

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,280
and the cheese is like

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,078
it doesn't taste like any cheese I've

52
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,780
ever had before

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,460
it tastes like

54
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,979
[Music]

55
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,360
it's like really

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,400
savory

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,318
this one's really great the ingredients

58
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,139
were not so easy to come by in U.S but I

59
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,300
found them

60
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,699
this next recipe came from Nigeria it

61
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:35,340
uses indomie noodles onions tomatoes

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,400
peppers and they recommended an egg on

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,959
top

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,560
so just chop up all the vegetables cook

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,598
them

66
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,000
boil the noodles

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,900
add the flavoring combine them all and

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,759
top with the egg

69
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,259
this one looks really good

70
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:04,080
kind of have to

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,919
break the yoga

72
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,479
totally different flavor than the last

73
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,818
noodle dish

74
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,639
and it is really good

75
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,759
it's like a very springy noodle

76
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,220
I like the Simplicity of this recipe

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,400
a little spicy very creamy the onions

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,658
are great

79
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,539
pepper is great tomatoes grapes

80
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,878
the egg yolk

81
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,560
it makes it creamier they said you could

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,120
add it or don't add it who doesn't want

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,039
to add an egg and this is a totally

84
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,180
totally satisfying dish

85
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,878
this next dish comes from Italy

86
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:45,158
there's chicken flavored instant noodles

87
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,000
a can of tuna cheese tomato avocado and

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,019
soy sauce

89
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,560
so you're gonna boil the noodles

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,720
drain most of the water add the flavor

91
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,720
packet add the cheese a can of drained

92
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,598
tuna fish and then top it with avocado

93
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,039
tomato and lastly a bit of soy sauce

94
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,280
this one was the most work so far a lot

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,019
of ingredients I actually really had to

96
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,419
follow the recipe

97
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,280
smells really good it's totally

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,900
different than anything I would ever

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,419
think to do with instant noodles

100
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,279
okay

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,220
the soy sauce is actually a really nice

102
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,720
touch on top it's got like an

103
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,899
interesting saltiness

104
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:29,839
it's funny it's totally growing on me

105
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,519
it's definitely got a heaviness and the

106
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,779
tomatoes do a really good job of

107
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:38,060
lightening that between the cheese and

108
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,100
the tuna and just you know the pasta

109
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,600
it's funny because in the person's note

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,060
they said trust me it's delicious all

111
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,470
right

112
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,880
[Music]

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,220
this submission came from Nepal and it's

114
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,459
why my noodles with onion tomato Ginger

115
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,160
lime juice and green chili you're gonna

116
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,639
mash up the noodles

117
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,800
cut up your vegetables

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,139
put them in a bowl add the noodles to

119
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,300
the Bowl put in some lime juice add the

120
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,100
seasoning packet and you're done

121
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,160
[Music]

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,459
okay this is the first instant noodle

123
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,918
dish that did not require any cooking

124
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,910
which I'm pretty excited about

125
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,139
[Music]

126
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,680
there's a freaking kick

127
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,899
I'm sweating

128
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,519
the tomato is nice it helps break down

129
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,139
the spice a little bit the lime juice

130
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,360
definitely a plus more than just

131
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,500
softening the noodles it definitely

132
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,579
helps a little bit with the heat

133
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:40,680
adding the green chili on top of the

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,918
spice packet that was a bold move

135
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm really sweating

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,759
oh

137
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,560
I feel this would be really good with a

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,180
beer

139
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,019
that's really good

140
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,199
I like it

141
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,360

Trinidad and Tobago for this one I

143
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,918
needed spicy instant noodles so I just

144
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,100
added Sriracha KFC fried chicken and bok

145
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,079
choy take the skin off the chicken and

146
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,680
cook it so I put it in my air fryer

147
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,360
take the meat off of the bones your

148
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,459
hands are going to get really greasy put

149
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:21,220
that in a pot with the flavor packet

150
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:24,000
and some water let it boil add the bok

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,060
choy stems cook them for a bit add the

152
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,240
leafy part cook that for a bit and then

153
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,660
add the noodles put it in a bowl and

154
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,899
then you're gonna top it with the crispy

155
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,279
chicken skin

156
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,478

160
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,899

161
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,199
wow Honestly though that crispy chicken

162
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,940
skin

163
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,199
game changer

164
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,940

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,160

167
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,660
is that what Fried Chicken does

168
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,459
the noodles are Top Ramen had them

169
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,319
before I think adding the Sriracha

170
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,660
totally worked to make it spicy because

171
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,720
it's got a kick

172
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,579
also having the big pieces of chicken in

173
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:26,098

174
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:28,759

175
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,860
soft noodles you have the leafy greens

176
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,839

181
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:49,339

00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:51,259
egg scallion onion cheese and chicken

183
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,418
stock powder you're gonna cook the

184
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,978

together

190
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,959
don't pay so much attention to the

191
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,699
monitor that you spill all the noodles

192
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,620
and have to start again

193
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,459
make little pancakes fry them and then

194
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,740
top with a bit of melted cheese

195
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,379
well this one was definitely a lot of

196
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,220
work

197
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,560
foreign

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,019
that is an absolute Delight it's salty

199
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:33,779
and it's crispy and it's soft I love the

200
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,000
idea of taking instant noodles and

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,519
making these pancakes

202
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,440
the big chunks of onion in it are really

203
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,418
great the noodles just become a part of

204
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,639
the batter almost and the cheese is

205
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,620
great on top like it's fun but you don't

206
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,539
need it either I think I might eat one

207
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,039
more

208
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,639
I'm just gonna finish up

209
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,159
all right

210
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,580
this recipe was submitted from India

211
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,740
so for this dish you need Maggie

212
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,320
tomatoes onions peppers a little bit of

213
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,279
ghee and paneer put some ghee in the pan

214
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,279
add the vegetables add the chopped

215
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,600
paneer

216
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,419
a little bit of salt cover it

217
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:16,419
then you're gonna add noodles and some

218
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,440
water

219
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,679
cook it uncovered

220
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,580
and you're done

221
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,500
okay

222
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,320
this one smells really good

223
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,299
hot

224
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,779
the flavoring for these noodles

225
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,458
totally different flavor than any of the

226
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,839
other noodles I've tried

227
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,700
there's a similar base between this and

228
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,380
the Nigerian dish

229
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,240
but I cooked it with a little bit of

230
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,139
ghee

231
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,700
and so that adds a nice little flavor

232
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,679
kick and then the paneer is really nice

233
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,259
it's chewy and it's creamy and these

234
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,539
noodles are very bouncy

235
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,159
that's a good bite

236
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,620
and the Maggie flavoring is just really

237
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,839
good

238
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,639
in the great debate of why my noodles

239
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,679
versus Maggi noodles I feel like these

240
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,639
are two totally different noodles

241
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,259
the noodles taste totally different I

242
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,070
couldn't necessarily compare them

243
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,659
[Music]

244
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:22,820
this last recipe is a submission from

245
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:25,559
Singapore it uses ramyan cheese egg milk

246
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:28,500
scallion and chili flakes start by

247
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,380
cooking the noodles in milk

248
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,500
add some cheese add the flavor packets

249
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,259
add the chili flakes and then you're

250
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:40,839
gonna crack an egg and cover the pot

251
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,100
garnish with scallions

252
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,839
all right

253
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,339
this one smells luxurious

254
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,399
okay there's a lot to unpack here

255
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,279
this recipe is instantly comforting the

256
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,380
flavor packet for this is spicy but then

257
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,958
the cheese and the Egg combine

258
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,820
to make it really creamy

259
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,139
I've never cooked noodles and milk

260
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,039
before wow Game Changer really good when

261
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,779
you crack the egg in here the egg white

262
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,880
kind of cooks inside the noodles so you

263
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,559
get these pockets of egg white which is

264
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,360
really fun

265
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,700
man if I had known this recipe in

266
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,620
college

267
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,000
I would have been a happy happy student

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,299
wow this was such an amazing week not

269
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,759
only were your dishes delicious but they

270
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,200
were inventive

271
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
I knew that instant noodles were a

272
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,639
universal food but I had no idea how

273
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,399
customizable they could be and seeing

274
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,899
all the recipes from around the world

275
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,139
just really opened my mind

276
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm going to put a link below so that

277
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,639
you can see the thread and look through

278
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,320
all the other recipes because I highly

279
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,179
recommend you try some of them I'm

280
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,679
obviously going to also include the

281
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,860

converted I want to try more of them now

285
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,440
I also really enjoyed this experience of

286
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,120
trying to use different foods here at my

287
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,980
house because it shows that all of these

288
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,440
dishes are attainable you don't have to

289
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,299
necessarily travel to those countries to

290
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,940
get a taste of them so maybe I'll try it

291
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,380
again I don't know what do you think is

292
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,000
there another food I should do this with

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,980
that's kind of all I got

294
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,320
go try some of those noodle dishes you

295
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,080
will not be disappointed I promise

296
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,000
