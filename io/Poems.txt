Title: My Life Has Been the Poem
Poet: Henry David Thoreau

My life has been the poem I would have write
But I could not both live and utter it.

Title: I'm Nobody! Who Are You?
Poet: Emily Dickinson

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.
How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog.
To tell your name the livelong day.
To an admiring bog!

Title: Dreams
Poet: Robert Herrick

Here we are all, by day,
by night we're hurled by dreams,
each one into a several world.

Title: No Man Is An Island
Poet: John Donn

No man is an island, 
entire of itself; 
every man is a piece of the continent,
a part of the main 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, 
Europe is the less, 
as well as if a promontory were, 
as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: 
any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind, 
and therefore, 
never send to know for whom the bell tolls; 
it tolls for thee.
